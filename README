This is a repo that I will be using for working through the book 'Purely Functional Data Structures' in javascript.

Thanks to Anthony Green (rarepleasures) for the book last fall.

I'm using node.js to run my tests, you can use the following command:

node <path_to_spec_file>

ex:
node spec/ch2/list_spec.js

I am using the common.js module format that node supports, so you probably could port them easily to another javascript runner.
